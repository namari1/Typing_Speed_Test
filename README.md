# Typing Speed Test
This typing speed test will measure how many gross and net words per minute (WPM) you can type, as well as your accuracy.
To begin, you can click the next button below which will take you to the test.
You will have 60 seconds to type the words you see in the textbox on the next screen after you click the start button.
The characters will turn green if you typed them correctly or red if you typed them incorrectly.
Make sure to type the characters exactly as they are (punctuation and capitalization matter).
You have the opportunity to fix any mistakes you make by backspacing.
At the end of the minute, a pop-up box will come up with your results (gross and net WPM and accuracy).
