# Typing Speed Test
This typing speed test will measure how many gross and net words per minute (WPM) you can type, as well as your accuracy. </br> </br> 
To begin, you can click the next button below which will take you to the test. </br> </br> 
You will have 60 seconds to type the words you see in the textbox on the next screen after you click the start button. </br> </br> 
The characters will turn green if you typed them correctly or red if you typed them incorrectly.</br> </br> 
Make sure to type the characters exactly as they are (punctuation and capitalization matter). </br> </br>  
You have the opportunity to fix any mistakes you make by backspacing.
At the end of the minute, a pop-up box will come up with your results (gross and net WPM and accuracy). </br> </br>
